Draw your chosen Bridget Riley image in a Canvas tag, using the Canvas drawing API. Do not include mouseover actions or any other event handling — we’ll add the events next week. Construct the image with canvas's vector drawing commands, not with drawImage().

You will probably want to use drawing commands within for loops to create the patterns in your selected image.

Size the canvas tag dynamically to make it fill the screen of both your laptop and your phone. Your canvas drawing must work on your phone, and stretch to the edges of your phone’s screen. To do this, a time-saving tip is to draw your shapes mathematically, rather than using hard-coded co-ordinates.
